## Standard Library

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Advanced filesystem APIs (watch, permissions, symlinks) | Deferred | `std.fs` covers the Phase 4A sync API surface |
| Networking and pipes | Deferred | `std.net` is next wave |
| Calendar/date formatting APIs | Deferred | `std.time` currently covers instant, duration, Unix timestamps, elapsed time and sleep |
| Advanced regex APIs (groups, captures, flags, Unicode classes) | Deferred | `std.regex` currently covers validation, match, full match, first/count/find all, split, replace all and escape for simple patterns |
| Public generic stream abstraction | Deferred | |
| Async IO | Deferred | |
| TLS | Deferred | |
| Websocket | Deferred | |
| Package registry integration | Deferred | |
| Optional dependencies / feature flags | Deferred | |

## Compiler

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Incremental compilation | Deferred | |
| Optimization passes beyond C compiler | Deferred | |
| Source maps / debug info generation | Deferred | `#line` directives exist |
| Plugin or extension system | Deferred | |

## Runtime

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Cycle collection in RC | Deferred | RC cycles = leak risk |
| Thread-safe reference counting | Deferred | Use isolates |
| Custom allocator hooks | Deferred | |
| Separate compilation units in C runtime | Deferred | |
| `map` specializations beyond `map<text,text>` | Deferred | |

## ZIR Notes

- ZIR textual format (`.zir` files) = debug, fixtures, golden tests ONLY
- ZIR structured in-memory representation = canonical contract between stages
- Frontend never produces or consumes `.zir` files directly
